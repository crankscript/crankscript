<h1 align="center">Crankscript</h1>

Crankscript is a collection of tools that lets you write Playdate games in TypeScript. TypeScript code is enriched with Playdate type definitions, and transformed to Lua with [TypeScript-to-Lua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/).

> [!NOTE]
> Crankscript exists thanks to [this Playdate Dev Forum thread](https://devforum.play.date/t/playdate-sdk-with-typescript/). Special thanks to Andy for contributing the TypeScript-to-Lua plugin and the initial d.ts file, and to Orta for providing the require transformation code.

## Getting started

The `crankscript` cli application is the main entry point for using Crankscript. To create a new project, use the command:

```sh
npx crankscript@latest new <project-name>
```

Optionally, a template can be specified:

```sh
npx crankscript@latest new <project-name> --template <template-name>
```

However, at the moment, only the "blank" template is available.

After that, install all dependencies with:

```sh
cd <project-name>
npm install
```

Build the project and run it in the Playdate Simulator with:

```sh
npm run simulator
```

That's it!

## A note about platform support

A more detailed documentation is in progress. For now, here's an important note about platform support.

The `simulator` command supports `--watch`. In MacOS, when a change is detected, the simulator is launched again. This will not open a new simulator window, but will instead reload the game in the existing window.

This behavior is not supported in Linux or Windows, so a workaround is needed. In those platforms, it is possible to use the following command:

```sh
npm run simulator -- --watch --recompile-only
```

This will recompile the project when a change is detected, but the simulator will not be reopened. In order to see the changes, a reload must be triggered from the Lua side.

The package `@crankscript/core` provides a helper function which can do just that. It will check the latest modified time of "main.pdz" at regular intervals, and if a change is detected, it will reload the game using `playdate.file.run`.

To use the utility, simply wrap your update function with it.

```ts
import { withReload } from "@crankscript/core";

playdate.update = withReload(() => {
    // Your update code here
}, {
    // It is possible to specify the interval in milliseconds
    interval: 1000 // this is the default interval
});
```

Please report any issues you encounter.
